# International Template

If you need help coming up with good sentences for your resume, use the prompt from the "prompts" folder and input it into an LLM to ask questions. I strongly recommend trying it for yourself first; write down your own ideas, then ask the agent how you can improve them. Asking it to build your whole resume from scratch will likely result in a generic text, and HR professionals will probably notice.

You can provide the agent with something like this (don't forget to attach the other prompt):

> "My main goal is to find [international, national] roles. I have a preference for [US, EU, SA, etc.] companies, but I'm also open to opportunities in [US, EU, SA, etc.].  
> Currently, (I'm working as a [your role]) OR (I'm a [your degree] student), and I'm looking for [level, e.g., entry-level, senior] [role you desire] roles.  
> First, let's go through each topic on my resume to check for grammatical mistakes and find better ways to phrase what I've written. I want you to focus on the [American, European, Brazilian] professional landscape and be mindful of the terminology you use."

## Template Sections

### Education
- For each educational experience, list the university, location, degree, and dates.
- Place this section directly below the header and above the Experience section if youâ€™re applying for your first job or an internship; otherwise, leave it at the end of your resume.

### Leadership Activities
- This section is great for showing initiative and teamwork outside of traditional work experience.

### Experience
- Use action verbs to describe your accomplishments. Quantify your impact whenever possible.
- Detail your professional experience, starting with the most recent.
- Focus on achievements rather than just duties. Use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to frame your bullet points.
- Highlight transferable skills like mentorship, communication, and collaboration.

### Skills
- Keep this section concise and relevant to the jobs you are applying for.
